# Pre-Course: Linux Console Basics
## Your Gateway to Molecular Modelling

> **Welcome, Future Molecular Modellers!** 
>
> Before we dive into proteins and simulations, you need to befriend the **terminal**. 
> This pre-course takes ~2 hours and teaches you the essentials to navigate your VirtualBox without fear.
>
> Think of your console as a **quest interface** — we'll unlock it step by step. 🗺️

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this pre-course, you will:

- ✅ Navigate the filesystem confidently (`cd`, `pwd`, `ls`)
- ✅ Create, copy, and manage files and folders
- ✅ Edit text files with `nano`
- ✅ Use pipes and wildcards to combine commands
- ✅ Search files with `grep` and find
- ✅ Understand file paths (absolute vs. relative)
- ✅ Be comfortable running commands on your VirtualBox

**Time investment:** ~2 hours (can be split across days)

---

## Part 1️⃣: Welcome to the Terminal

### What is the Terminal/Console?

The **terminal** (also called *console* or *shell*) is a text-based interface to your computer. Instead of clicking buttons, you type commands. 

**Why use it?**
- ✨ Powerful automation (run 100 commands at once)
- ✨ Precise control (no ambiguity, always exact)
- ✨ Scientific computing standard (Gromacs, Avogadro, your tool all use it)
- ✨ Reproducibility (commands can be written down and re-run)

### First Steps: Open Your Terminal

On your **OpenSUSE + KDE** (VirtualBox):

1. Click the **Application Menu** (bottom left)
2. Search for **"Konsole"** or **"Terminal"**
3. Click to open

You should see something like:

```
user@hostname:~$ 
```

**Congratulations!** You're in. 🎉

---

### The Terminal Anatomy

```
user@hostname:~/some/path$ command -option argument
│     │         │          │       │       │
└─────┴─────────┴──────────┤       │       │
   User, computer, where    │       │       │
   you are right now         │       │       │
                    ┌────────┘       │       │
                    │  The command   │       │
                    │  (what to do)   │       │
                    └────────────────┘       │
                       Flags/options ────┐   │
                       (modify behavior)  │   │
                       Arguments ─────────┴───┘
                       (input data)
```

---

## Part 2️⃣: Navigation — Finding Your Way

### Command: `pwd` — Where Am I?

**`pwd`** = "**Print Working Directory**"

It tells you exactly where you are in the filesystem.

**Try it:**

```bash
pwd
```

Expected output:
```
/home/user
```

The `/` at the start means **root** of the filesystem. Everything starts there.

---

### The Filesystem Tree

Your computer's files are organized like this:

```
/                          ← ROOT (everything starts here)
├── home/                  ← User home folders
│   └── user/              ← YOUR home folder (~)
│       ├── Documents/
│       ├── Downloads/
│       └── Desktop/
├── usr/                   ← System programs & files
├── etc/                   ← Configuration files
├── tmp/                   ← Temporary files
└── opt/                   ← Optional software (Gromacs, etc.)
```

When you open the terminal, you **start in** `/home/user` (aka `~` = "home shortcut")

---

### Command: `ls` — List Files

**`ls`** = "**LiSt**"

Shows what's in your current folder.

**Try it:**

```bash
ls
```

Expected output (depends on your system):
```
Desktop    Documents    Downloads    Pictures    Videos
```

**Make it fancier:**

```bash
ls -la
```

- `-l` = **Long format** (details: permissions, size, date)
- `-a` = **All** (including hidden files, those start with `.`)

Example output:
```
drwxr-xr-x 10 user user 4096 Oct 27 10:30 .
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 Oct 20 15:00 ..
drwxr-xr-x  2 user user 4096 Sep 15 12:00 Desktop
drwxr-xr-x  2 user user 4096 Sep 15 12:00 Documents
-rw-r--r--  1 user user  245 Oct 26 09:00 .bashrc
```

**Read it:**
- `d` = directory (folder), `-` = regular file
- `rwx` = read, write, execute permissions
- `user user` = owner, group
- `4096` = file size in bytes
- `Oct 27 10:30` = last modified

---

### Quiz: Understanding `ls -la`

What does the `d` at the start of `drwxr-xr-x` mean?

- [[X]] It's a directory (folder)
- [[ ]] It's a device file
- [[ ]] It's a deleted file

---

### Command: `cd` — Change Directory

**`cd`** = "**Change Directory**"

Move to a different folder.

**Try it:**

```bash
cd Documents
pwd
```

Now you should see:
```
/home/user/Documents
```

---

### Path Types: Absolute vs. Relative

**Absolute path:** Starts with `/`, always works from anywhere
```bash
cd /home/user/Documents    # Works from everywhere
```

**Relative path:** Doesn't start with `/`, relative to where you are NOW
```bash
cd Documents               # Only works if Documents is in current folder
```

**Special shortcuts:**

| Command | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `cd ~` | Go to home folder |
| `cd` | Go to home folder (same as above) |
| `cd ..` | Go up one level (parent folder) |
| `cd -` | Go back to previous folder |
| `cd .` | Current folder (useful later) |

**Try the journey:**

```bash
pwd                   # See where you are
cd ..                 # Go up one level
pwd                   # Check location
cd -                  # Go back
pwd                   # Should be in Documents again
```

---

### Challenge 1️⃣: Navigate to `/usr/bin` and Back

**Your task:**
1. Navigate to `/usr/bin` (absolute path)
2. List the files
3. Go back home
4. Print your working directory to confirm

**Solution (reveal when ready):**

```bash
cd /usr/bin
ls
cd ~
pwd
# Should print: /home/user
```

---

## Part 3️⃣: Working with Files & Folders

### Command: `mkdir` — Make Directory

Create new folders.

```bash
mkdir my_project
ls
```

Output:
```
my_project
```

**Create nested folders:**

```bash
mkdir -p my_project/data/raw
# -p = "parents" (creates all needed folders)
```

---

### Command: `touch` — Create Empty File

Create an empty file (or update timestamp of existing file).

```bash
cd my_project
touch README.txt
ls
```

Output:
```
README.txt
```

---

### Command: `cp` — Copy Files

Copy files or folders.

**Copy a file:**

```bash
cp README.txt README_backup.txt
ls
```

Output:
```
README.txt    README_backup.txt
```

**Copy a folder (recursively):**

```bash
cp -r data data_copy
# -r = recursive (includes all contents)
```

---

### Command: `mv` — Move or Rename

Move/rename files and folders.

**Rename:**

```bash
mv README_backup.txt README.bak
ls
```

**Move to subfolder:**

```bash
mv README.bak data/
ls data/
```

Output:
```
README.bak
```

---

### Command: `rm` — Remove Files

**Delete a file:**

```bash
rm README.bak
```

⚠️ **CAREFUL:** No trash/undo in terminal! Use with caution.

**Delete a folder (recursively):**

```bash
rm -r data_copy
# -r = recursive
```

---

### Quiz: File Commands

What command removes a file permanently?

- [[ ]] `delete file.txt`
- [[X]] `rm file.txt`
- [[ ]] `erase file.txt`

---

### Challenge 2️⃣: Build a Project Structure

**Your task:**
1. Create a folder `protein_sim` in your home
2. Inside, create subfolders: `inputs`, `outputs`, `analysis`
3. Create a file `log.txt` in the main folder
4. Copy `log.txt` to `outputs/log_backup.txt`
5. List everything to confirm

**Solution:**

```bash
cd ~
mkdir -p protein_sim/{inputs,outputs,analysis}
cd protein_sim
touch log.txt
cp log.txt outputs/log_backup.txt
ls -la
ls -la outputs/
```

---

## Part 4️⃣: Editing Text Files

### Command: `nano` — Simple Text Editor

`nano` is a beginner-friendly text editor. Open any file:

```bash
nano log.txt
```

You now see:

```
  GNU nano 7.2                                          New Buffer
  
  
  
  
^G Get Help     ^O Write Out    ^W Where Is     ^K Cut Text     ^J Justify
^X Exit         ^R Read File    ^\ Replace      ^U Paste Text   ^T To Spell
```

---

### Nano Basics

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+X` | Exit (prompted to save) |
| `Ctrl+O` | Save (Write Out) |
| `Ctrl+W` | Find text |
| `Ctrl+K` | Cut line |
| `Ctrl+U` | Paste |
| `Ctrl+G` | Help |

**Try it:**

1. Type some text:
```
This is my first simulation project!
```

2. Press `Ctrl+O` → Press `Enter` to save
3. Press `Ctrl+X` to exit
4. Open it again: `nano log.txt`
5. You should see your text!

---

### View File Content (without editing)

**`cat`** — Print entire file to screen

```bash
cat log.txt
```

Output:
```
This is my first simulation project!
```

**`less`** — View large files (page by page)

```bash
less log.txt
# Press 'q' to quit
```

---

## Part 5️⃣: Powerful Combinations - Pipes & Wildcards

### Pipes: `|` — Chain Commands

A **pipe** `|` sends output of one command as input to the next.

**Syntax:**
```bash
command1 | command2
```

**Example — Find long output easier:**

```bash
ls -la | grep "txt"
# Shows only lines containing "txt"
```

**Example — Count files:**

```bash
ls | wc -l
# wc = "word count" (-l = lines, i.e., count them)
```

**Real use case from molecular modelling:**

```bash
gmx energy -f ener.edr | tail -20
# Shows last 20 lines of energy output
```

---

### Wildcards: `*` and `?` — Pattern Matching

**`*`** = any characters (0 or more)

```bash
ls *.txt          # All files ending in .txt
ls protein_*      # All files starting with protein_
ls *.pdb *.gro    # All .pdb or .gro files
```

**`?`** = exactly one character

```bash
ls file?.txt      # file1.txt, fileA.txt, but not file12.txt
```

**Real use case:**

```bash
cp *.xyz /backup/     # Copy all .xyz files to backup
rm energy_*.edr       # Remove all energy files
```

---

### Challenge 3️⃣: Create and Organize Files

**Your task:**
1. Go to `protein_sim/inputs`
2. Create 3 files: `mol1.xyz`, `mol2.xyz`, `opt.inp`
3. List only `.xyz` files using wildcard
4. Count how many files are in this folder

**Solution:**

```bash
cd ~/protein_sim/inputs
touch mol1.xyz mol2.xyz opt.inp
ls *.xyz
ls | wc -l      # Should be 3
```

---

## Part 6️⃣: Searching & Finding

### Command: `grep` — Find Text in Files

**`grep`** searches for text patterns in files.

**Syntax:**
```bash
grep "pattern" filename
```

**Example:**

Create a file with content:
```bash
cat > simulation.log << EOF
Step 1000, Energy = -245.5 kcal/mol
Step 2000, Energy = -250.3 kcal/mol
Step 3000, Temperature = 298.15 K
EOF
```

Now search:

```bash
grep "Energy" simulation.log
```

Output:
```
Step 1000, Energy = -245.5 kcal/mol
Step 2000, Energy = -250.3 kcal/mol
```

**Case-insensitive search:**

```bash
grep -i "energy" simulation.log
# Same result, even if you wrote "ENERGY"
```

**Count matches:**

```bash
grep -c "Energy" simulation.log
# Output: 2
```

---

### Real Use Case: Extract Energy Values

After a Gromacs simulation, you have many lines. Extract only energy:

```bash
grep "Potential" energy.log | tail -1
# Gets last energy value
```

---

### Command: `find` — Locate Files

Find files by name, size, date, etc.

**Basic syntax:**
```bash
find /path -name "pattern"
```

**Examples:**

```bash
find . -name "*.xyz"              # All .xyz in current folder and subfolders
find ~ -name "protein*"           # All files starting with "protein"
find /tmp -name "*.tmp"           # All .tmp files in /tmp
```

---

### Quiz: Pipes and Wildcards

What does this command do?

```bash
ls *.pdb | wc -l
```

- [[X]] Counts how many `.pdb` files are in the current folder
- [[ ]] Lists all `.pdb` files and their full paths
- [[ ]] Removes all `.pdb` files

---

## Part 7️⃣: The Big Quest — Let's Practice!

Now let's combine everything in a realistic scenario:

**Scenario:** You're setting up for a protein simulation campaign. You need to:

1. Create a project structure
2. Add some mock input files
3. Find and organize them
4. Create a summary file

---

### Quest Steps:

**Step 1: Create structure**

```bash
cd ~
mkdir -p MD_campaign/{proteins,simulations,analysis}
cd MD_campaign
```

**Step 2: Add some protein files**

```bash
cd proteins
touch protein_1A.pdb protein_2B.pdb protein_3C.pdb
touch ligand_A.mol2 ligand_B.mol2
touch README.txt
cd ..
ls proteins/
```

**Step 3: Create simulation setup**

```bash
cd simulations
touch run1.mdp run2.mdp run3.mdp
touch equilibration.gro production.gro
cd ..
```

**Step 4: Find all `.pdb` files**

```bash
find . -name "*.pdb"
```

Expected output:
```
./proteins/protein_1A.pdb
./proteins/protein_2B.pdb
./proteins/protein_3C.pdb
```

**Step 5: Count them**

```bash
find . -name "*.pdb" | wc -l
# Output: 3
```

**Step 6: Create a summary**

```bash
nano SIMULATION_LOG.txt
```

Type:
```
My First MD Campaign
=====================
Date: Oct 27, 2025
Status: Setup Phase

Files prepared:
- 3 protein structures
- 2 ligands
- 3 simulation input files
```

Save (`Ctrl+O` → Enter → `Ctrl+X`)

**Step 7: Verify**

```bash
ls -la
cat SIMULATION_LOG.txt
```

---

### Final Challenge 🏆: Your Own Project

**Do this:**

1. Create a folder called `my_molecule` in your home
2. Create subfolders: `structures`, `calculations`, `results`
3. Create 3 files: `molecule.xyz`, `settings.txt`, `notes.md`
4. Edit `settings.txt` with your favorite method parameters
5. List everything with `ls -la`
6. Count all files: `find my_molecule | wc -l`

**Show your work:**

```bash
cd ~/my_molecule
ls -laR    # R = recursive, shows everything
```

✅ **You just completed a realistic workflow!**

---

## Part 8️⃣: Common Traps & Tips

### Don't Do This ❌

```bash
rm -rf /              # This deletes EVERYTHING (don't do!)
rm -r *               # In wrong folder = disaster
```

### Do This Instead ✅

```bash
rm -i filename        # -i = ask for confirmation
ls -la first          # Check before deleting
rm one_specific_file  # Be specific
```

---

### Useful Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Tab` | Auto-complete (press twice for options) |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate command history |
| `Ctrl+C` | Stop current command |
| `Ctrl+L` | Clear screen |
| `Ctrl+A` | Go to start of line |
| `Ctrl+E` | Go to end of line |

**Tab completion example:**

```bash
cd Doc[TAB]           # Auto-completes to "Documents"
ls *.py[TAB][TAB]     # Shows all matching files
```

---

### The Holy Trinity of Help

**1. Manual pages (detailed):**

```bash
man ls              # Read full documentation (press 'q' to exit)
man grep
```

**2. Help flag (quick):**

```bash
